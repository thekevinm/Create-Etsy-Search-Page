Though their winemaking days are behind them, their distinctive character lasts on. Decades of careful cultivation combined with the vines natural tendency to create their own whimsical chaos yields striking compositions. With some careful shaping and finishing, each piece becomes a work of art suitable for warming the heart of a true wine lover.\r\n\r\nAfter its retirement from wine production, each grapevine is pruned by hand to reveal, preserve and promote the essence of its form in a process that takes over a year.\r\n\r\nOur wine barrels are sourced from the best wineries in California including Napa, Sonoma, Temecula, Santa Barbara and more. They are dried for a year to insure they are dried perfectly for your project.\r\n\r\nThe result speaks for itself. Each piece has its own character, some seeming to rest in serene meditation, some to dance in playful glee. Look. Touch. The warmth of the wood invites your fingers to trace contours, follow branches, contemplate the flow of life which took a century to express itself in the shape you see before you.\r\n\r\nI am the only artist in the world who makes tables out of century old vines and these limbs create new shapes with every new angle, beckoning freshly in rich play of dimensions. Like a fine wine, the tables are rich, complex and always offer something new to the senses. What better way to honor your wine? Serve it on a work of art that celebrates the natural forces that created the grape.\r\n\r\nMy awesome staff and I take pride on providing customers with the best quality products, expert personal service and I take enormous joy and satisfaction in creating my products and hope that you will find something that you will enjoy and love.\r\n\r\nHave an idea, we love a fun challenge! Creating custom designs is our favorite thing ever. Well after ice cream. Oh and chocolate. Please let me know what we can design and create for you!\r\n\r\nAll our products are proudly made here in the USA.\r\n\r\nWe are a Green Company and my products are 100% recycled!\r\n\r\nThank you and I am excited to design and build for you!\r\n\r\nMichael","policy_payment":"We accept credit cards via Etsy&#39;s Direct Checkout feature, cashier checks and money orders.

Digital files only, NO physical product will be mailed to you.\n\nIf using as clipart, the images are saved at 300 ppi and can be printed 8.5 x 11 or smaller.\n\nIf using for cutting: You are responsible for making sure that the file formats offered here are compatible with your machine\/software... PRIOR to purchasing. Because of the digital nature of this product, refunds are not available. \n\nI am only familiar with the silhouette cameo software, you DO NOT have to have the designer edition to cut these. You can open and cut a jpeg or png using the trace tool. It is very easy and takes just seconds to do. After tracing it becomes completely scalable {like the svg} and can be made as large or small as needed. You can also separate the pieces (if using more than one color), by releasing the compound path.

With this in mind, we do our best to use only the best of the materials so we can to limit the natural use flaws.  Recycled material flaws may include rust on metal products, natural pitting of the metal, nicks and rub marks on bottle labels, differences in shapes of used horseshoes, scratches and rub spots or nicks on cowhides, and possible cracks and gaps in old barn wood.\r\n\r\nCustom Orders and Personalization\r\n\r\nPlease contact us for custom order requests so we can send a quote!  We love working with customers to create their vision.

If this ever happens please notify us so that we can notify the shipping company.  \r\n\r\nFragile items shipped will always include insurance in case of harsh handling by the shipping company.  Again, if your order arrives damaged please notify us so we can fix the problem!  We may ask for a photo of the damaged product for proof of damage, mostly to show evidence to the shipping company of the damage during handling!  \rFor replacement items due to shipping damages, items will be shipped after shipping claims are completely filed.  \n\r\nETA- Every package will include a tracking number.\r\nWhen an item is shipped, depending on the carrier, in general most items will arrive within a week of the ship date.  Etsy should notify you when a package is shipped! Please allow additional shipping time during holidays, especially during Christmas.  Holiday seasons can delay shipment up to two additional weeks because of the amount of packages in transit.   \r\n\r\nExpress Shipping can be purchased depending on the order size and customization of the order.  If desired, please contact us for express shipping additional costs.  \r\n\r\nInternational Shipping can be a bit more expensive but can be done so please contact us for quotes on the items you would like to order.  We do our best to keep the shipping costs as low as possible, however most of the shipping costs are out of our control! Packages may also take longer to arrive due to distance and customs.","policy_refunds":"Refunds and Exchanges\r\nIf your order arrives and it is not what you ordered or it is damaged please let us know immediately before you leave a feedback.

If the product arrives damaged or altered in any way then the refund will be not be issued.  \r\n","policy_additional":"Questions and Answers\r\n\r\nQ. Will the cake topper be too heavy for my cake?\r\nA. We have not had any problems with the weight of the cake toppers with prongs.  If you are concerned with the weight of the horseshoe you may want to order as early as possible to do a testing before it is placed in the initial cake.  Prongs can be somewhat adjustable on width and angle just by pulling on them with slight force.  \r\n\r\nQ. Will my item rust? \r\nA. Our metal creations are coated with a clear coating to deter rust. We can\u2019t guarantee against rust in the future, because over time rust will happen. No one has a way to prevent rust permanently. How and when an iron item will rust, is dependent on the climate where you live. In humid climates, outdoor metal items will rust, and if you use a can of clear coat over a cleaned up surface, you are ready to keep rust at bay. Indoor items are better protected and may need a touchup periodically.\r\n\r\nQ. Will you send to another address as a gift? \r\nA. Yes, we will send to another address. Let us know if this is the case - we can&#39;t tell otherwise. We are happy to accommodate a special message to the recipient at your request on the packaging slip or you can purchase a card for an additional $5 from our site to include with the order.  If purchasing a card with order please notify what kind of card and type the message you would like it say!  If gift wrapping is desired you can also purchase the gift wrap ad for an additional $3We now have a listing for gift-wrapping, which is purchased separately:\r\n\r\nQ. Do you combine shipping?\r\nA. YES, we are happy to combine shipping on multiple items.  As our items vary greatly in size & weight, combined shipping cannot be set to automatically calculate.  On orders like this we will combine items as much as possible to one box then refund your account the difference in shipping costs. \r\n\r\nQ. How do I leave a REVIEW for you?\r\nA. In the upper right hand corner is a link called &quot;Your Account&quot;. Click on it and the first choice is Purchases & Reviews, for a review. We appreciate your comments. If you are not happy, we want to make it right, so contact us first before leaving a negative review.

(Shipping time excluded)\r\n\r\nProduction time will be longer if:\r\n\r\n1) You opt for our no-interest layaway plan. After your balance is paid in full, your ring will be scheduled for production.\r\n\r\n2) You are sending in materials to for use in making your ring.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your order is time-sensitive, we recommend purchasing an additional $50 Rush Order upgrade, and leaving the desired delivery date in the notes of your order.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccurate Ring Sizing\r\n\r\nWe have found that the great majority of all exchanges are because the initial ring is too big. Most of our designs are produced with a unique, incredibly comfortable comfort fit inside the ring. If you are not used to wearing a ring, then it is likely everything will feel too tight to start. However, getting the ring too loose will cause it to catch on something or possibly fall off and lose it. Because of this, we ask you to size your finger by the &quot;Bend and Twist&quot; method. Once you have a ring sizer over your knuckle, you should have a bit of &quot;resistance&quot; in taking it off. When taking a ring off you should bend your knuckle slightly and twist it. If you try to pull it straight back over your knuckle, it will catch the skin and not give an accurate size.\r\n\r\nBecause we cannot size you personally, we will make the ring in the size you provide to us. It is the customer\u2019s responsibility to be certain of size before ordering. Please double check the options that you have selected on your ring before placing your order.\r\n\r\nThere is always the possibility of slight sizing discrepancies from jeweler to jeweler. We use United States\/Canada Size as our sizing scale. Our sizing is set to International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Sizing for our comfort fit rings is digitally sized once the ring is finished and a 2nd time during our quality check, before shipping.\r\n\r\nWe do not recommend the use of online printable ring sizers. The safest option is to have your size checked at a reputable jewelry store or local jeweler. Please bear in mind that all of our rings come standard with comfort fit.\r\n\r\nWe are also familiar with International and Foreign sizing. If you need help converting your sizes to US sizing, please contact us for instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReturns\/Refunds\r\n\r\nIf you decide to return your ring for any reason, you must do so within 14 days of delivery. Once you have returned the ring, we will issue you one of two options; 1) an in-store credit for the full amount of your order, or 2) a refund back to the original payment method minus a 25% restocking fee. Returned items must be in good condition. Buyer is responsible for return shipping costs. If you need to return your ring, please contact us via the contact page or email us at contact@stonebrookjewelry.com for return instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder Modifications or Cancellations\r\n\r\nIf you need to modify or cancel your order, please advise us of those changes within 3 days of placing the order. For any order cancellations after 3 days, there will be a 25% restocking fee. If you need to modify your order, please contact us via the contact page or email us at contact@stonebrookjewelry.com.\r\n\r\n\r\nSize Exchanges\r\n\r\nIf you need to change the size of your ring after you have received it, there is a Size Exchange Fee of 10% of the original retail price of the order, within 30 days of delivery. For any size exchange after 30 days, the fee is 25% of the original retail price. Buyer is responsible for return shipping, and the shipping for the newly sized ring. Return shipping is $10 extra for the USA and $16 International. If you need to do a Size Exchange, please contact us via the contact page or email us at contact@stonebrookjewelry.com for exchange instructions.\r\n\r\nOnce the original ring is returned and fees are paid, we will then make and ship a new ring. We will only exchange the ring once for the 10% fee. Any Size Exchanges following that will be the 25% fee.\r\n\r\nSize Exchanges can be made for the same style ring and do not allow for any changes in the ring style to be made. (Width, Inlays, Etc.) If any changes in the style are requested, the 25% fee will apply. (See Style Exchanges section below)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStyle Exchanges\r\n\r\nIf you would like to change the style of your ring, and you have already passed the 14 day return period, you can still do so, but there will be a 25% remake fee for the new ring. If your new ring is more expensive than your original ring, you will be responsible to pay that difference. Buyer is responsible for return shipping, and the shipping for the new ring. Return shipping is $10 extra for the USA and $16 International.

For details, see individual items.\n\nESTIMATED SHIPPING TIME\nCanada: 1 - 2 weeks\nUnited Kingdom: 2 - 3 weeks\nNorth America: 5 - 7 business days\nEurope: 2 - 3 weeks\nAustralia, New Zealand and Oceania: 2 - 3 weeks\n\nI'll do my best to meet these shipping estimates, but cannot guarantee them. Actual delivery time will depend on the shipping method you choose.\n\nCUSTOMS AND DUTIES FEES\nBuyers are responsible for any customs or duties fees that may apply. Sellers aren't responsible for delays due to customs","policy_refunds":"I GLADLY ACCEPT RETURNS, EXCHANGES, AND CANCELLATIONS\nJust contact me within: 14 days of delivery\nShip returns back to me within: 30 days of delivery\nRequest a cancellation within: 2 hours of purchase\n\nTHE FOLLOWING ITEMS CAN'T BE RETURNED\nBecause of the nature of these items, unless they arrive damaged or defective, I can't accept returns for:\n- Custom or personalized orders\n\nCONDITIONS OF RETURN\nBuyers are responsible for return shipping costs.\nIf the item is not returned in its original condition, the buyer is responsible for any loss in value.\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT YOUR ORDER?\nPlease contact me if you have any problems with your order.","policy_additional":"I will only use your shipping and billing address, and contact information\n- To communicate with you about your order\n- To fulfill your order\n- For legal reasons (like paying taxes)\n\nWHAT DOES FLAT $5.95 OR $9.95 S&H ADVERTISEMENT MEAN?\nDepending on the listings, there are some products that will only cost you $5.95 for standard USA shipping and for larger products it will be $9.95 for standard USA shipping. \n\nThis means the max shipping you can possibly pay for 1, 100 or 1000 items is either $5.95 or $9.95! (Applies to US states only)\n\nDO YOU OFFER DISCOUNTS OR COUPONS?\nYes! Please visit my shop home page announcement section to see any current promotions, coupons and specific listings may be on sale!\n\nWHAT IS YOUR PRODUCTION AND SHIPPING TIME?\nPlease consider both the production time and shipping transit time to calculate approximately when your order will arrive. For most products, production takes 3-5 business days. When selecting your shipping choice at checkout you have the option of also upgrading to rush production for $15 extra. Rush production takes 1-2 business days. Please visit the various shipping options during checkout to expedite your delivery time.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ORDERS & SHIPPING\nStandard international shipping can take 2-3 weeks for transit time. It is a flat rate price based on your delivery country. Each additional product added is FREE to ship! Faster shipping upgrade options are available at checkout. Please note the BUYER is responsible for all duties and taxes accessed by your country. Potential duties and taxes are not included in your shipping price.\n\nWHERE DO I PUT MY ENGRAVING INSTRUCTIONS?\nDuring your checkout there will be a &quot;Add note to seller&quot; box where you can describe your engraving details and personalization. You may also request a mock-up here. Please note that requesting a mock-up can delay your order by 1-2+ days as I create the design and await the approval.\n\nCAN I GET THIS DELIVERED BY CHRISTMAS?\nYes! For domestic orders please select the shipping option at checkout that states &quot;Guaranteed By Christmas&quot;. The orders placed with the Guaranteed By Christmas option will get priority production and shipping time over those placed with Standard. At this time, with &quot;standard shipping&quot; I cannot guarantee it will arrive by Christmas. For international shipping I will need your city and zip code to quote you.","policy_seller_info":"","policy_updated_tsz":1458927014,"policy_has_private_receipt_info":false,"vacation_autoreply":null,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/shop\/EngraveMyMemories?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","image_url_760x100":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/102\/0\/9611223\/iusb_760x100.16618431_tdxw.jpg","num_favorers":4476,"languages":["en-US"],"upcoming_local_event_id":null,"icon_url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/176\/0\/9611223\/isla_fullxfull.26528151_spjxzjzd.jpg","is_using_structured_policies":true,"has_onboarded_structured_policies":true,"has_unstructured_policies":true,"custom_shops_state":1,"include_dispute_form_link":false,"is_direct_checkout_onboarded":true,"is_wholesale_only":false}},{"listing_id":496701251,"state":"active","user_id":101649607,"category_id":69150425,"title":"Whiskey Quote Magnet | Gift for Whiskey Lover | Cocktail decor | Cheap Bar Decor | Decorative Magnet | Shot of Whiskey |Bourbon Babe","description":"Whiskey, or Bourbon, rather, is our drink of choice.
